                <p>I decided to buy a  princess costume pattern from Joann Fabrics and make adjustments based on the green curtain design. I also found these great curtain tassells at my local fabric store that were super inexpensive that really helped me nail my design. The most fun I had was creating the velvet bonnet with feathers. I would often reference costume photos to make sure I stayed as authentic as possible to the original.
